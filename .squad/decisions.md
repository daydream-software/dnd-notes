# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### 2026-04-12: @copilot is enabled as a coding agent with auto-assignment
**By:** FFMikha (via Copilot)

**What:**
`@copilot` is part of the squad roster and may automatically pick up issues labeled `squad:copilot`.

**Why:**
This gives the team an autonomous coding lane for small, clearly specified work without blocking the named squad members.

### 2026-04-11: GitHub Actions must be pinned to commit SHAs
**By:** FFMikha (via Copilot), Brand, Mikey

**What:** 
All GitHub Actions references in `.github/workflows/` and `.squad/templates/workflows/` must be pinned to commit SHAs instead of using floating major-version tags (e.g., `@v4`, `@v7`).

**Actions updated:**
- `.github/workflows/sync-squad-labels.yml` — replaced `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/github-script@v7` with pinned SHAs
- `.github/workflows/squad-triage.yml` — replaced `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/github-script@v7` with pinned SHAs
- `.github/workflows/squad-heartbeat.yml` — replaced `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/github-script@v7` (×3) with pinned SHAs
- `.github/workflows/squad-issue-assign.yml` — replaced `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/github-script@v7` (×2) with pinned SHAs
- `.squad/templates/workflows/*` — updated all template mirrors to match

**Why:** 
Organization security policy prohibits floating action tags. Pinning to immutable commit SHAs ensures reproducibility, prevents uncontrolled action updates, and satisfies org compliance requirements.

**Scope:** All public and internal GitHub Actions in active workflows and templates.

**Implementation notes:**
- Major-version comments retained inline for clarity
- squad-heartbeat.yml maintained across 4 locations — source template updated, synced via `squad upgrade`
- This is a mandatory enforcement rule, not optional

## Governance

- All meaningful changes require team consensus
- Document architectural decisions here
- Keep history focused on work, decisions focused on direction
