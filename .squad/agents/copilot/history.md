## Recent Updates

📌 Team update (2026-04-12T21:44:58Z): ASSIGNMENT — You are now owner of Issue #27 frontend UI revision. Stef's implementation was rejected by Chunk due to four critical state-management regressions: (1) `noteBrowseMode` dependency causes workspace reload on mode toggle, clobbering editor state, (2) create-note drafts lost when workspace reloads, (3) stale-response race on session switch, (4) missing regression tests. Backend (#27) is approved and ship-safe. Re-approval bar: remove `noteBrowseMode` from bootstrap dependency chain, add cancellation guard to session loading, add tests for mode toggles and create-note reset.

📌 Team update (2026-04-13T00:04:28Z): Issue #27 UI COMPLETED & MERGED. Your revision successfully retired all four rejection criteria: browse-mode state isolated from `loadWorkspace` dependency (synchronous state management), draft preservation tested, stale-response race eliminated by `useMemo` design, comprehensive regression test coverage added (3 web + 3 API tests). PR #36 merged on main (`9d0966b`). **Potential FALLBACK ASSIGNMENT: Issue #33 (Recent Activity UI)** — Primary owner is Stef (frontend); if Stef is unavailable, you're the fallback. Thin slice v1 scope: read-only activity feed UI (notes sorted by `updatedAt`), collaborator filter sidebar, distinguish 'created' vs 'edited' actions with attribution, empty state handling. Backend contract stable (`GET /api/notes/activity`). Regression test plan documented (RT1–RT5 gates). Expected delivery: 2–3 days. Files: `App.tsx` (tab + filter state), `api.ts` (fetchActivity), `types.ts` (activity types), `App.test.tsx` (tests). See `.squad/orchestration-log/2026-04-13T00:04:28Z-issue-33-ui-handoff.md` for full context — decided by FFMikha (product), Chunk (reviewer)
